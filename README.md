# Todolst
This Todo List project is a simple yet powerful tool for managing your tasks efficiently. Built with React, it allows users to add new tasks, mark them as completed, and delete tasks they no longer need. Users can also filter tasks based on their status (Pending, Completed), providing flexibility in task management.
